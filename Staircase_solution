// for n = 6 ,  i and j values starts at the same time . for the first line j and and i values equals to 1 or (zero)  then we need 5 spaces and
//1 hashe , so we put n-i spaces in second for loop which include j value, 
// then for the second line  we need 4 spaces and 2 hashes for that we put n-i beacause i =2 anymore and with third loop which is incuding k , 
// should put 2 hashes , it means hashe's count is equal to i value , so we put i hashe  , that means , (k = 1 ; k<=i ; k++)
